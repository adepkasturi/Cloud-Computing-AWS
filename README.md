# Cloud-Computing-AWS

The aim of this project is to build an elastic and responsive real-time objection detection application using AWS resources and Raspberry Pi based IoT devices. 
For every motion detected by the sensor, videos will be recorded and darknet will be used to perform object detection on them. The results of the application will be stored on Amazon S3 along with the video input.

For more implementation and design details refer to README.pdf
